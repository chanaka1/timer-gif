Timer GIF
=========

This sample project shows how to create an animated GIF timer that counts down to a specific point in time.  A demo of the project can be found at <http://timer.ewal.net>.

This is an ASP.NET MVC application (albeit a very simple/small one).  To host it as-is, you'll need a Windows server with IIS 7 or higher and .NET 4.0 or higher.

Thanks to Simon Bridewell for his GifComponents library and its support for creating animated GIFs in C#
