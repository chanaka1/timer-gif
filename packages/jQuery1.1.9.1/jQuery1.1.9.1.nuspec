    <description>JQuery has split into two versions. One that supports older browsers (1.x) and a new version that has dropped support (2+) does not support IE6/7/8. If you build websites and you use the JQuery NuGet
      package you have to remember to NOT update your JQuery. In addition other packages that have not been tested with verson 2 can use this package as a depedency instead of JQuery to prevent project
      update errors.
      
      Updating JQuery will update your package to version 2+ of JQuery. This package is JQuery1 and can be installed along with jQuery in the same project.
      
      At the top of your View you would then include a directive for example like this.
      
      
          &lt;!--[if lt IE9]
              &lt;script src="jquery-1.9.1.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
          &lt;![endif]--&gt;
          &lt;!--[if gte IE 9]&lt;!--&gt;
              &lt;script src="jquery-2.0.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
          &lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt;
      
      
      According to JQuery there will be new versions of JQuery 1.x in the future.  This package will be updated to reflect that change and ease deployment.</description>
    <summary>JQuery version 1.x that is designed to be installed next to JQuery latest which has dropped support for new Browsers.</summary>
